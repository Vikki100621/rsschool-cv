## About me: 
I decided to radically change my life. Almost 5 years I was out of place. Now I am ready to take up new challenges. 
I am a hardworking, ambitious and solutions-oriented person with a great passion for the Front-end web development. 
I always strive for excellence.
I am capable of working in a team as well as independently while under the pressure of multiple deadlines. 
My motto is practice makes perfect.
